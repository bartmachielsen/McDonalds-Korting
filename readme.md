# McDonald's Korting

## Not working anymore
About an half year ago McDonald's changed their app and architecture.

The McDonald's app contains Coupons for getting discount on some products. This app keeps track of all privacy related information in exchange for some discount.

This project is meant for replacing this app by an public website that contains all coupons.

The project succeeded and does automaticly crawl the newest coupons. This website is available at www.McDonalds-korting.nl

## Features:
- All active coupons (the app only selects 3/6)
- Coupons that have been expired in the last two weeks (most of the time still usable)
- Notifications about new coupons (www.McDonalds-korting.nl/nieuwsbrief)
- Barcode of all coupons that is scannable by the new welcome screen.


## Future:
- Add The "December calendar"
- Community system for validating expired coupons
